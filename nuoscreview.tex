\subsection{The atmospheric sector: SK, K2K, Minos, T2K  (MZ)}

In this subsection we will describe the status of the so called atmospheric neutrino oscillations, i.e. the 3-2 oscillations that were first discovered in the study of atmospheric neutrinos and later were precisely measured with the use of long baseline neutrino beams.   


\subsubsection{The atmospheric neutrino flux}

The atmosphere is constantly bombarded by primary cosmic rays, composed mainly of protons, with a smaller component of $\alpha$ particles and heavier nuclei. The interaction of these particles with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere produces hadronic showers composed mainly of pions and kaons. The decay of these mesons according to 
$\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ followed by 
$\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu $,
$K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ \nu_\mu$ and $K_L \rightarrow \pi^+ e^- \nu_e$
together with their charge conjugated processes, produces a flux of $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_e$ with a steeply falling power-law spectrum (Fig. \ref{fig:nuatmflux}).

   \end{minipage}
    \caption{The flux of atmospheric neutrinos (left) and several flux ratios (right) \cite{ref:midori}. }
 \label{fig:nuatmflux}
\end{figure}


The calculation of this neutrino flux \cite{ref:Ga2002} relies on the knowledge of the primary flux and composition, of the Earth magnetic field, and of the hadro-production cross-section. Recent studies \cite{ref:midori,ref:barr,ref:fluka} taking into account 3D effects and recent measurements of the hadro-production cross-sections largely improve on previous efforts and reach precisions of 7-8 \% for the flux in the 1-10 GeV range. It should be noticed that the ratio $N(\nu_\mu + \bar{\nu}_\mu)/N(\nu_e + \bar{\nu}_e)$ is predicted with a much better precision of a few \% as several systematic uncertainties cancel in this ratio. In the limiting case where all the muons from pion decays decay themselves in flight, this ratio is close to 2, as can be easily deduced from the decay processes mentioned above.

\subsubsection{The early days, the up-down asymmetry and controversy}

The study of atmospheric neutrinos started in the 1960: two experiments in very deep mines, in South Africa \cite{ref:reinesAtm} and in India \cite{ref:achar}, observed muons produced by their interactions. 
In the 1980, several massive underground experiments, mainly motivated by the search for the proton decay predicted by Grand Unification theories, started collecting data. These experiments needed to study in detail atmospheric neutrino interactions as they constitute a background for proton decay searches.

In 1988, Kamiokande reported a deficit in the number of $\nu_\mu$ of events, while the number of $\nu_e$ events agreed with the prediction. This started the so-called atmospheric neutrino anomaly. This deficit was also observed by the IMB experiment and later by MACRO and SOUDAN-2, while Fr\'ejus and NUSEX observed no deficit. 


\subsubsection{The evidence for atmospheric neutrino disappearance}
%from Super-Kamiokande}


The situation evolved rapidly with the advent of Super-Kamiokande, that started data-taking in 1996. Super-Kamiokande is very large water Cherenkov detector located in the Mozumi mine (Gifu prefecture, Japan), under a 1000 m rock overburden, equivalent to 2700 m of water. It is a stainless steel tank (41.4 m high, 39.3 m diameter) containing 50 kt of ultra-pure water. The detection volume is partitioned in an outer detector, composed of 1885 8 inch PMTs, and an inner detector with 11146 20 inch PMTs. The fiducial volume is 22.5 kt. Super-Kamiokande could rapidly accumulate a rather large data set of atmospheric neutrinos, measuring the direction of the produced lepton, its energy for fully contained events and their nature. Above a few hundred MeV/c, the direction of the produced lepton is strongly correlated to the direction of the incoming neutrino.  

In 1998, the Super-Kamiokande collaboration presented their first analysis of atmospheric neutrinos~\cite{ref:skatm98}, in particular the distributions of zenith angle for $ \nu_\mu$ and $\nu_e$ event selections (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sk-atm} for an updated distribution) based on 33 kton year. This was the first compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations as the explanation of the previously mentioned anomaly.  

Indeed the neutrino path from the production to the detection varies from 15 km for down-going neutrinos (cosine of the zenith angle equal to 1) to more than 12000 km for up-going neutrinos having traversed the whole Earth (cosine of the zenith angle equal to -1), thereby probing a large span of possible oscillation lengths. 

In a two neutrino scenario, the $\nu_\mu$ disappearance is governed by $\sin^2 (2 \theta) \sin^2 (4 \Delta m^2 L /E)$, where $\theta$ is the relevant mixing angle and $\Delta m^2$ the squared-mass difference of the mass eigenstates. A glance at Fig.\ref{fig:sk-atm} reveals several important overall features: 
\begin{itemize}
\item there is a strong disappearance of $\nu_\mu$, especially visible for up-going neutrinos. As the survival probability for very long baseline approaches $1/2 \sin^2 (2 \theta)$, and the observed survival probability is close to 0.5, the mixing angle is therefore close to the maximal value $\pi/4$. 
\item The disappearance sets in for neutrinos close to horizontal zenith angle, and therefore the oscillation length should be of the order of 400 km for energy around 1 GeV, or $\Delta m^2 \simeq 10^{-3}$eV$^2$.  
\item There is no sizeable excess or deficit of $\nu_e$. Therefore the oscillations of $\nu_{\mu}$ should mainly involve either $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\tau}$ or $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_s$, where $\nu_s$ is an additional neutrino state.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[htbp]

are shown for data (filled circles with statistical
error bars), MC distributions without oscillation (boxes)
and
best-fit distributions (dashed). The box height shows the
statistical error.}
 \label{fig:sk-atm}
 \end{figure}

Independently of any accurate predictions of the neutrino flux, the experimental observation of the distributions of Fig.\ref{fig:sk-atm} is sufficient to make a strong case for neutrino disappearance. Indeed, above several GeV, the neutrino flux is isotropic, as the primary cosmic rays are not deflected in a significant way by the geomagnetic field. The observation of a zenith angle dependent deficit of the neutrinos is then a sufficient argument to conclude that these neutrinos undergo a non-standard propagation.  

While in 1998 other hypotheses like decay or decoherence were still open, more recent data from long baseline accelerator experiments have ruled out all explanations apart from oscillations because the alternative hypotheses imply a different L/E behaviour. 
    
The IceCube experiment at the South Pole has recently completed the installation of DeepCore, a denser array of optical modules, aimed at significantly lowering the muon threshold. With data recorded between 2011 and 2014, corresponding to 5074 observed events, they have recently published an analysis of the disappearance of atmospheric $\nu_\mu$  \cite{ref:icecubedis} in the range 10-100 GeV, requiring the zenithal angle to satisfy $\cos theta < 0$,  which has a similar sensitivity to that of Super-Kamiokande (Fig. \ref{fig:icecubeosc}) with the prospects of further improvements.

\subsubsection{Long-baseline neutrino beams }

Neutrino beams\cite{ref:kopp} based on particle accelerators have been used since the 1960s, when they provided the evidence for the existence of two types of neutrino, $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$. The general design is based on a high intensity proton beam impinging on a target and producing pions and kaons through interactions on the target nuclei. 
These mesons decay in a dedicated volume downstream of the target, creating mainly a $\nu_\mu$ beam.  

The long baseline beams are based on the so called wide band beam concept. Here the secondary charged mesons are focused using a system of magnetic devices, called horns. The horns, usually with a cylindrical symmetry around the beam, are pulsed with a very intense current in coincidence with the arrival of the beam. 
%The ratio between the primary proton energy and the typical neutrino energy is %at least a factor ten, and the neutrino spectrum extends for about a decade %around this typical energy.  

The flux is tuned in such a way that the phase $\Delta m^2_{32} L/ (4 E)$ reaches $\pi/2$ for the design baseline $L$ and the peak energy $E$, in order to probe the atmospheric oscillation sector with the beam $\nu_\mu$. To do so, the proton energy, the target length and width, the focussing system and the decay volume length and width need to be accurately designed and optimized.   

An off-axis neutrino beam \cite{ref:beavis} relies on the following idea: as the $\nu_\mu$ are mainly produced by the two-body decays of pions, there is a correlation between pion energy $E_\pi$, the neutrino energy $E_\nu$ and the decay angle $\theta$ 
\begin{equation}
E_\nu = \frac{(1-(m_\mu/m_\pi)^2) E_\pi}{(1+\gamma^2 \theta^2) } 
\end{equation}
valid in the limit of small angles.

Neutrinos emitted at a small angle with respect to the pion direction have a distinct narrow spectrum peaking at a much lower energy with respect to the on axis beam. This feature that has been used by the T2K and NOvA experiments, offers several advantages because it avoids the large high energy tail of the on axis beam, thereby reducing some background reactions. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{energy_miniboone.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/offaxis.pdf}
  \caption{Neutrino energy as a function of the pion energy for on-axis decays and several off-axis angles. For a non-zero off-axis angle, the neutrino energy reaches a maximum. This feature is currently exploited in the T2K and NOvA experiments.}
 \label{fig:offaxis}
 \end{figure}


As the neutrino beam is a tertiary beam, it is necessary to include in the experimental apparatus monitoring devices to ensure that it is stable in intensity and direction. To this effect, muon detectors, sensitive to the muons produced by the pion decays, are placed close to the end of the decay volume. Moreover, as the neutrino flux and cross-sections and the beam composition are not known with sufficient precision, a near detector is located close to the target station (typically within a few hundred meters). The near detector constrains the neutrino interaction rate, proportional to the product t=of neutrino flux and the cross-section. Moreover, the near detector allows to measure the beam composition and to perform study of several neutrino cross-section.

\subsubsection{Results from long-baseline accelerator experiments K2K MINOS T2K NOVA}

K2K (KEK-to-Kamioka) was the first long baseline neutrino beam, using Super-Kamiokande as its far detector at 290 km from the neutrino production. Operating between 1999 and 2004, it has measured the disappearance of $\nu_\mu$: 112 events were observed, while 158.1$^{+9.2}_{-8.6}$ were expected without oscillation, a 4.3 $\sigma$ effect. This measurement has confirmed neutrino oscillation as the explanation for the atmospheric neutrino disappearance. 

Further precision measurements of the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$ were reported by MINOS, T2K and NOvA.

We will here describe in some detail the T2K measurement, the most precise for what concerns the $\theta_{23}$ angle.

\subsubsection{Evidence for $\nu_\tau$ appearance}

The OPERA experiment on the CERN to Gran Sasso neutrino beam, taking data between 2008 and 2012, was designed to test the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$ appearance hypothesis. The detector is based on the Emulsion Cloud Chamber technique, with 1800 ton of nuclear emulsion detectors in the forms of bricks, each brick being composed of a stack of nuclear emulsion film and lead plates. This target, capable of sub-micrometric track resolution, is devoted to the study of the neutrino interaction vertex and the particles associated to it. The identification of the $\tau$ leptons relies mainly on their characteristic kink (Fig.~\ref{fig:opera}) due to the decay $\tau \rightarrow h \nu_\tau$, or $\tau \rightarrow l \nu_\tau \bar \nu_l$, where $h$ is a charged meson, and $l$ is an electron or a muon. Another signature is related to the decay $\tau \rightarrow 3 h \nu_\tau$ where the short $\tau$ track ends in a three-pronged vertex. The target detectors are complemented by scintillator trackers and muon spectrometers. 

OPERA has observed 5 $\nu_\tau$ candidate events \cite{ref:opera} with a total background of 
$0.25 \pm 0.05$ events, mainly coming from decays of charmed particles. This corresponds to a 5.1 $\sigma$ observation of $\nu_\tau$ production in an oscillated $\nu_\mu$ beam. 

The Super-Kamiokande collaboration has also searched for $\nu_\tau$ appearance in multi-ring events to test the hypothesis of $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$ oscillations. While the selected sample is affected by large backgrounds, there is an excess of tau-like events in the upward-going direction with a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$, offering a complementary confirmation of the OPERA result.
